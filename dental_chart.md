ok i think we are missing the dentist endpoint inbackend , so just tell what is then expected response from backend for dentist so that i can udpate the same in backend 

Based on the code we've implemented, here's the expected response format for the dentist endpoint:
Dentist Endpoint
URL: /api/v1/clinics/{clinic_id}/dentists/
Method: GET
Expected Response Format:
}
Key Fields in the Response:
count: Total number of dentists
next: URL for the next page (if paginated)
previous: URL for the previous page (if paginated)
results: Array of dentist objects with the following properties:
id: Unique identifier for the dentist
username: Username for login
first_name: First name of the dentist
last_name: Last name of the dentist
email: Email address of the dentist
The frontend code expects this format to populate the dentist dropdown in the appointment form. The dentist's name will be displayed as "Dr. {first_name} {last_name}" in the UI.
If you need to implement this endpoint in the backend, you'll likely want to filter users who have a dentist role in the clinic's membership.
ok cool I have implemented the same and you can refer the implemntation through this test @test_dentists.py . and update the @Codebase if you need any change for this 

Looking at the test file you've shared, I can see you've implemented the dentist endpoint correctly. The test shows that the endpoint should return a list of dentists with their details, which matches what our frontend code expects.
Based on the test implementation, here's what the dentist endpoint should return:
}
This matches what our frontend code expects in the appointmentService.getDentists() method. The test verifies that:
The endpoint returns a 200 OK status
The response includes a "results" array
The array contains the expected number of dentists
Each dentist object has the required fields: id, username, first_name, last_name, and email
The test also checks access control, ensuring that users can only access dentists from clinics they are members of, which is a good security practice.
No changes are needed to our frontend code as it already expects this format. The AppointmentForm component should now be able to load and display the dentists correctly in the dropdown.
ok now the issue is we are getting error for timeslot endpoint , ideally the url should looks like this GET /api/v1/clinics/{clinic_id}/time-slots/?dentist={dentist_id}&date={date}&selected_time={selected_time} and you can see the implementsation here @test_time_slots.py 

I see the issue. Based on the test file, the time slots endpoint is different from what we're using in our frontend code. Let's update the appointmentService.getAvailableTimeSlots method to match the correct endpoint:
And we also need to update the TimeSlot interface to match the response format:
Now let's update the AppointmentForm component to use this updated method correctly:
4 hidden lines
And update the time slot rendering in the form:
These changes will update our code to use the correct time slots endpoint as shown in the test file. The key differences are:
The endpoint URL is /clinics/{clinic_id}/time-slots/ instead of /clinics/{clinic_id}/appointments/time-slots/
The query parameter is dentist instead of dentist_id
The response format includes a time_slots array with time, available, and optionally selected properties
We're now handling the selected_time parameter to indicate which time slot is currently selected
ok now the issues are in appointment list page the aptient name is not properly loaded also on clicking view its returning back to list page the appointment list is correctly returning the repsonse like thjis {
    "count": 1,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "patient": 4,
            "patient_name": "tes1",
            "dentist": 3,
            "dentist_name": "Pooja Satheesh",
            "date": "2025-03-16",
            "start_time": "10:30:00",
            "end_time": "11:00:00",
            "status": "scheduled",
            "status_display": "Scheduled",
            "duration_minutes": 30
        }
    ]
}

I see the issue. The appointment list response format is different from what our frontend code expects. Let's update the appointment service and the appointment list page to handle this format correctly.
First, let's update the Appointment interface in the appointment service:
Now, let's update the appointments page to handle this format correctly:
4 hidden lines
23 hidden lines
11 hidden lines
9 hidden lines
23 hidden lines
6 hidden lines
10 hidden lines
5 hidden lines
Now let's create a new appointment detail page to handle viewing an appointment:
10 hidden lines
These changes should fix the issues with the appointment list and detail pages. The key updates are:
Updated the Appointment interface to match the backend response format
Updated the appointment list page to display patient_name and dentist_name correctly
Created a new appointment detail page to view appointment details
Added functionality to cancel appointments and update their status
now in appointment detail page we are not filling the aptient details , doctor name and nothing , also int the same screen we should be having the opotion to see the existing debntalk chart of tehe patient and also the treatment histories . the appointment endpoint response is corrredlty fetching this datas {
    "id": 1,
    "patient": {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "tes1",
        "age": 34,
        "gender": "M",
        "phone": "06464742671",
        "email": ""
    },
    "dentist": {
        "id": 3,
        "username": "pooja",
        "full_name": "Pooja Satheesh",
        "email": ""
    },
    "date": "2025-03-16",
    "start_time": "10:30:00",
    "end_time": "11:00:00",
    "status": "scheduled",
    "status_display": "Scheduled",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "notes": "sdfsdfsdf",
    "created_at": "2025-03-16T09:30:34.336741Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-03-16T09:30:34.336810Z"
}

I see the issue. The appointment detail endpoint is returning nested objects for patient and dentist, but our current interface doesn't match this structure. Let's update the Appointment interface and the appointment detail page to handle this correctly.
First, let's update the Appointment interface:
Now, let's update the appointment detail page to handle both formats (nested objects and flat structure):
30 hidden lines
78 hidden lines
13 hidden lines
This updated code:
Modifies the Appointment interface to handle both nested objects and flat structures
Adds helper functions to get patient and dentist information regardless of the response format
Displays detailed patient information when available
Adds tabs for Dental Chart and Treatment History
Provides links to the patient's profile, dental chart, and treatment history
Shows appointment history with creation and update timestamps
Improves the overall layout and organization of the appointment details
The page now handles both response formats and provides a more comprehensive view of the appointment and related patient information.
ok now it looks cool , nbut the issue , is when we are upating the appointment status it is not correctly send to the correct endpoint , you can reffer this test for moe details @test_appointments.py , ideally it should look like /api/v1/clinics/1/appointments/42/update_status/ with body somehting like this body: JSON.stringify({
    status: 'completed'
  })

I see the issue. Let's update the updateAppointmentStatus method in the appointment service to match the correct endpoint format from the test file:
The key change here is updating the endpoint URL from /update-status/ to /update_status/ (replacing the hyphen with an underscore) to match the backend implementation shown in the test file.
This should ensure that the status update requests are sent to the correct endpoint. The request body is already correctly formatted as { status: 'completed' } or whatever status is being set.
ok now update the progress here in @api_integration_plan.md 

I'll update the API integration plan to reflect our progress:
This update shows that we've completed the appointment management section, including:
Listing appointments with pagination and filtering
Viewing appointment details
Creating new appointments
Updating appointments
Canceling appointments
Updating appointment status
Getting available time slots
Getting dentists for the appointment form
The next major areas to focus on are the dental chart, treatment plans, billing, and reporting features.
ok now please continue with next step , before proceeding please tell me which all endpoints you are goint to be used , where all you are going to be used , so i check the same in my backend 

For the next phase of our integration plan, we'll be focusing on the Dental Chart functionality. Here are the endpoints we'll need to implement:
