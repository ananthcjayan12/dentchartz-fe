@Codebase now getting this error when selecting timeslot intercept-console-error.ts:41 Error fetching time slots: Error: API request failed with status 400
    at fetchWithClinic (api.utils.ts:64:24)
    at async Object.getAvailableTimeSlots (appointment.service.ts:163:22)
    at async AppointmentForm.useEffect.fetchTimeSlots (AppointmentForm.tsx:156:23){"error":"Both date and dentist_id are required parameters."} , and the payload was lioke this dentist=3&date=2025-03-16&clinic_id=1 , you cansee the sample application through our backedn testfile @test_appointments.py 

Fixing the Time Slots API Request Error
Looking at the error message and the test file, I can see there's a mismatch between how the frontend is calling the time slots endpoint and what the backend expects. Let's update the getAvailableTimeSlots method in the appointment service to match the backend's expectations.
The key changes are:
Changed the query parameter from dentist to dentist_id to match what the backend expects
Updated the endpoint path to /clinics/${clinicId}/appointments/time-slots/ based on the test file
Made the response mapping more flexible to handle different response formats
This should resolve the 400 error you're seeing when trying to fetch time slots. The backend is expecting dentist_id as the parameter name, but the frontend was sending dentist
@test_appointments.py @test_time_slots.py still we are getting error 
http://localhost:8000/api/v1/clinics/1/appointments/time-slots/?date=2025-03-17&dentist_id=3&clinic_id=1 {detail: "Not found."}
detail
: 
"Not found." , you can reffer the the upodated backedn test for more idea and detail @test_time_slots.py @test_appointments.py 

I see the issue now. Looking at the test files, there's a discrepancy between the endpoint paths. Let me fix the getAvailableTimeSlots method in the appointment service to match the correct endpoint from the test files.
The key changes are:
Changed the query parameter back to dentist (not dentist_id) based on the test_time_slots.py file
Updated the endpoint path to /clinics/${clinicId}/time-slots/ which matches the URL in test_time_slots.py
Updated the response mapping to handle the time_slots array in the response
This should resolve the 404 "Not found" error you're seeing.
@Codebase here http://localhost:3000/patients/4/dental-chart when we are clicking on adding conditions @ToothDetailPanel.tsx  add some conditions for dropdown , som standard conditons , also an option to type custom similar to add procedure also add some pricedures

Adding Standard Conditions and Procedures to ToothDetailPanel
Let's update the ToothDetailPanel component to include standard dental conditions and procedures in the dropdown, along with an option to add custom entries.
3 hidden lines
18 hidden lines
10 hidden lines
62 hidden lines
162 hidden lines
This update adds:
Standard lists of dental conditions and procedures with codes and prices
Support for custom conditions and procedures with custom fields
Dynamic form behavior that shows/hides custom fields based on selection
Auto-population of price when selecting standard procedures
Updated form submission logic to handle both standard and custom entries
The dropdown menus now include all standard options plus an "Add Custom" option at the bottom. When a user selects a standard option, relevant fields like price are auto-populated. When they select the custom option, additional fields appear for entering custom information.
now on adding a condition and clicking on add condition getting this error 

Cavity (C01)

Expected number, received string




Fixing the Type Error in ToothDetailPanel
The error occurs because the condition_id is being passed as a string when the API expects a number. Let's fix this issue in the handleAddConditionSubmit function.
Similarly, let's fix the same issue in the handleAddProcedureSubmit function:
The issue is that when we select a condition from the dropdown, the value is being passed as a string (since HTML select values are always strings), but our API expects a number for the condition_id. The fix ensures we convert the string to a number before sending it to the API.
or do we ask the backend to send prfilled conditions , so that can we can use the samae in dorp down , also there should be an option to add custom procedure and condition which in turn create that procedure and condition backend , and netx time that will also be shown in list , so for this tell me what all backend calls you need and give me expected payload Nd response , so I can add the same in the backend @Codebase .
