## Implementation Strategy

1. **Service Layer Updates**:
   - Update each service file to use the real API endpoints
   - Maintain mock data for development/testing
   - Use environment variables to toggle between real and mock data

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement consistent error handling across all API calls
   - Create reusable error handling utilities
   - Add appropriate user feedback for API failures

3. **Loading States**:
   - Add loading indicators for all API operations
   - Implement skeleton loaders for better UX

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test each API integration individually
   - Create end-to-end tests for critical workflows
   - Verify error handling and edge cases
